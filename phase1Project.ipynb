    "This note book is designed to analyse data National Transportation Safety Board that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters  and identify the lowest-risk aircraft for the company to purchase and operate in the commercial and private aviation sectors, providing actionable insights to guide decision-making for the new aviation division\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, this will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using pandas to filter data\n",
    "* Using pandas to handle missing values\n",
    "* Using matplotlib to create a graph using data from a dataframe\n",

    "##  Task: Analyze Airplane Data\n",
    "\n",
    "###The following questions are to be answered from the analysis of the data:\n",
    "1. Determine which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor.\n",
    "2. Identify actionable insights to help decide which aircraft to purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "In this repository under the file path `AviationData.csv` there is a CSV file containing information about events that occured on various aircrafts\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also `USState_Codes.csv` which contains short form identifies of various states in the United states\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Filter Data to Relevant Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Filter Data to Relevant Rows\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Drop Rows with Missing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Identify lowest risk plane\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Plot charts to support the assement above\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below we import the relevant libraries, open up the CSV file as a dataframe called `df`, and convert cells containing `-` into cells containing `NaN` (because `-` was used to represent missing data in the original dataset).\n",
