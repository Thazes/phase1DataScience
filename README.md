# Phase 1 data Science Project



## Project Overview 

The data is sourced from kaggle and it aims to analyze aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 to determine which aircraft present the lowest risks for commercial and private operations.

In this repository under the file path AviationData.csv there is a CSV file containing information about events that occured on various aircraftsT

## Problem Statement

The following questions are to be answered from the analysis of the data:
1 Determine which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor.
2 Identify actionable insights to help the head of the new aviation division decide which aircraft to purchase.

### Tools used

I used the following tools for my analysis and presentation:

1 Anaconda Jupyter notebook for my data clean up and analysis of the data.
2 Tableaue public for creating dynamic visualizations
3 Github repository for version control

### Steps
1 I first analysed the data by getting number of null values at each column
2 I dropped all columns with null percentage values of over 40%
3 I cleaned the rest of the columns using measures of central tendecy that is the mean and median
4 I the identified a columns that I could used to analyse the data. The columns used were Make, model and Injury severity
5 From the analysis I recommended an aircraft therefore answering the problem Statement
